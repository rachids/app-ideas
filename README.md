## :ledger: App Ideas Collection

I am using this great project to enhance my knowledge in Frontend as my current frontend knowledge is limited to some basic jQuery.

I will try to work as much as I can, one project at a time, starting on the beginner tier.

## The stack I want to improve:

- Typescript and Javascript
- Setup and configuration of an npm environment
- Deno
- TailwindCSS

**I'd really appreciate a code-review.**
