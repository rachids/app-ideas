This is the first exercise that I make in order to learn how to use Typescript and enhance my frontend knowledge.

I have no idea how to not run `tsc` anytime I change my script.

## How to use

- Clone this repository
- `cd` to the folder of the app
- Run `tsc` to compile `app.ts`
- Access the app in your browser.

## Todo:

- Validate/sanitize the input.
- Figure out a basic Typescript setup to simply compile to a single out file without using module AMD or weird stuff like that.
- Keep trying until frontend is somewhat likable.
