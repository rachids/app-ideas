This is the first exercise that I make in order to learn how to use Typescript and enhance my frontend knowledge.

I have no idea how to not run `tsc` anytime I change my script.

## How to use

- Clone this repository
- `cd` to the folder of the app
- Run `npm install` to get the dependencies.
- Run `npx mix` to compile the scripts
- Access the app in your browser.

## Todo:

- Validate/sanitize the input.
